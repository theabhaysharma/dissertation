This repository implements a retail product relationship analysis using a network-based approach. The analysis builds upon the work of Tian et al., focusing on understanding how products complement or substitute each other within the retail environment. The project is divided into two main parts: the first part is a core research implementation mimicking the methodologies described by Tian et al., while the second part extends this analysis to introduce dynamic bundle pricing strategies and network centrality measures.

Introduction
Retail environments are complex ecosystems where products interact in various ways that go beyond simple categorizations. Understanding these interactions, particularly in terms of complementarity and substitutability, can provide valuable insights for optimizing pricing, inventory management, and marketing strategies. This project employs a network-based approach to map these product relationships, building upon the methodologies established by Tian et al. By visualizing products as part of a network, this approach uncovers patterns that traditional methods often overlook.

Core Research Idea
The first part of this project replicates the research conducted by Tian et al., aiming to model product relationships in a retail ecosystem using a bipartite product-purchase network. The core objective is to capture how products are either complements or substitutes, especially when prices change. A bipartite graph is constructed where products and transactions are represented as nodes, with edges indicating the presence of a product in a transaction. This structure allows for the calculation of complementarity and substitutability scores, which are central to understanding product interactions. The complementarity score is defined based on the degree of shared transactions, while the substitutability score is derived using the Jaccard similarity of the product transaction sets. These scores are then incorporated into a pricing model to maximize category profit, offering a more nuanced understanding of product relationships than traditional models.

Extended Analysis
Building on the core research, the second part of this project introduces enhancements that make the analysis more dynamic and applicable to real-world retail scenarios. One of the key extensions is the development of a dynamic bundle pricing strategy that adapts to the evolving structure of product relationship networks over time. This involves integrating time-dependent pricing strategies, which adjust prices based on the changing relationships between products. The project also employs network centrality measures, such as eigenvector centrality, to identify key products within the network. These central products are then used to optimize bundle pricing, cross-selling opportunities, and marketing efforts.

In addition to these enhancements, a price-based approach is developed to distinguish significant product relationships from random co-occurrences. This involves a statistical method that assesses the significance of product relationships using a Z-score, providing deeper insights into the product ecosystem. Visualization tools such as heatmaps and network diagrams are also incorporated to help interpret the findings, making it easier to identify patterns and derive strategic decisions for pricing and product management.
